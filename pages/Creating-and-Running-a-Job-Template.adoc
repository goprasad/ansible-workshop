Now that you've sucessfully created your Job Template, you are ready to launch it. Once you do, you will be redirected to a job screen which is refreshing in realtime showing you the status of the job.

NOTE: Alternatively, if you haven't navigated away from the job templates creation page, you can scroll down to see all existing job templates

Step 5: Sit back, watch the magic happen

Once the job is running, on the left, you'll have details in regards to what playbook it's running, what the status is, i.e. pending, running, or complete. You'll also notice the apache_test_message being passed in as an 'extra_variable.'

To the right, you can view standard output; the same way you could if you were running Ansible Core from the command line.

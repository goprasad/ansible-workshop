==== *+++<u>Step 5:</u>+++* 
Sit back, watch the magic happen

Once the job is running, on the left, you'll have details in regards to what playbook it's running, what the status is, i.e. pending, running, or complete. You'll also notice the apache_test_message being passed in as an 'extra_variable.'

To the right, you can view standard output; the same way you could if you were running Ansible Core from the command line.

You can also click on the nodes in the standard output under a specific task for additional information. ---

NOTE: In the event your company laptop is forced to route through your internal VPN and you can not disable the VPN client, you can access the lab systems via ssh by routing through; https://tools.bartlweb.net/webssh/

= *Lab #1. Ansible_Install*

For this lab, ansible has already been installed during the lab provisioning process.

To verify ansible is installed on your control machine (TRAINING-LAB-studentnn-ansible), ssh into the VM and type;

*ansible --version* +
*ansible --help*


Verify your ansible.cfg file looks like the following by typing cat ~/.ansible.cfg +
Example output: +
$ cat ~/.ansible.cfg
....
[defaults]
connection = smart
timeout = 60
inventory = ~instruct1/lightbulb/lessons/lab_inventory/instruct1-instances.txt
host_key_checking = False
....



= *Lab #2. Adhoc_commands*

TASK 1. Test that Ansible is setup correctly to communicate with all hosts in your inventory using the `ping` module;

[.lead]
*$ ansible all -m ping*

TASK 2. Fetch and display to STDOUT Ansible facts using the `setup` module;

[.lead]
*$ ansible all -m setup*

Example Output;
....
node-2 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_all_ipv4_addresses": [
            "10.0.1.57"
        ], 
        "ansible_default_ipv4": {
            "address": "10.0.1.57",

*TASK 3. Setup and enable the EPEL package repository on the hosts in the "web" group using the yum module;*

*$ ansible web -b -m yum -a "name=https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm state=present"*

NOTE: Run this the command the first time and notice the changes as identified in stdout.

*TASK 3b. Re-run the above command and notice ansible does not attempt any changes as the package has been installed. the new output from re-running the command should be similar to below;*

....
node-1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "failed": false,

*TASK 4. EXTRA CREDIT: Try running the following commands on your control node and review the output. The last command shows how to specify a specific node for exclusion using the "--limit" switch.*

*$ ansible all -m ping --limit '!control'*







= *Lab #3. Simple_playbook (nginx)* +
This example is designed to be used as a quick introduction to playbook structure that demonstrates how Ansible works.
This playbook assures the hosts in a group called "web" has the Nginx web server present and is started with a static custom home page. The hosts are presumed to be running a Red Hat family linux.

*TASK 1.* On your control node, change to the directory; /home/studentnn/lightbulb/workshops/ansible_engine/simple_playbook/resources (please note you will need to specify the correct user under the home directory)

To change directories, type; +
*$ cd /home/studentnn/lightbulb/workshops/ansible_engine/simple_playbook/resources*

Verify the index.html file is present but typing; *ls*

*TASK 2.* On your control node open an editor (such as vi or nano) and create the following ansible playbook (be sure to start with the 3 dashes in the first line);

You may need to run your editor as sudo - i.e. sudo vi simple_playbook.yml

i.e. http://34.229.6.4

If successful, you should see a web page with the Ansible logo.



= *Lab #4. Basic_Playbook (A more practical playbook)*

Create an Ansible playbook that will assure nginx is present, configured and running on all hosts in the "web" group:

....
1. Has variables for `nginx_test_message` and `nginx_keepalive_timeout`.
2. Assures that the following yum packages are present on the each web host:
    * nginx
    * python-pip
    * python-devel
    * gcc
3. Assure that the uwsgi pip package is present on each host.
4. Generate a host-specific home page with the value of `nginx_test_message` for each host using the provided `index.html.j2` template.
5. Generate a configuration with the value of `nginx_keepalive_timeout` for each host using the provided `nginx.conf.j2` template.
6. Assure that nginx is running on each host.
7. The playbook should restart nginx if the homepage or configuration file is altered.
....

While developing the playbook use the `--syntax-check` to check your work and debug problems. 

Run your playbook in verbose mode using the `-v` switch to get more information on what Ansible is doing.

Try `-vv` and `-vvv` for added verbosity. Also consider running `--check` to do a dry-run as you are developing.

*TASK 1.* On your control node, change to the directory; /home/studentnn/lightbulb/workshops/basic_playbook/resources (please note you will need to specify the correct user under the home directory)

To change directories, type; +
*$ cd /home/studentnn/lightbulb/workshops/ansible_engine/basic_playbook/resources*

Verify the index.html.j2 and nginx.conf.j2 files are present by typing; *ls*

= *Lab #5.* Roles +
Your assignment is simple: refactor the Ansible playbook you've been developing into a role called "nginx-simple".

This assignment should result in a drop in replacement that is portable and more modular. It does not add any new tasks or functionality.

1. Initialize your role with `ansible-galaxy init` in a new subdirectory `roles/`.

2. Refactor your existing basic playbook and associated resources into your role.

3. Create a new playbook that uses the role still targeting the "web" group.

*TASK 1:* cd /home/student1/lightbulb/workshops/ansibile_engine/roles +
*TASK 2:* mkdir nginx-role +
*TASK 3:* cd nginx-role +
*TASK 4:* mkdir roles +
*TASK 5:* cd roles +
*TASK 6:* Type; ansible-galaxy init nginx-simple +
*TASK 7:* cd nginx-simple +
*TASK 8:* Type ls and verify your directory structure;

....
$ ls
defaults  
files  
handlers  
meta  
README.md  
tasks  
templates  
tests  
vars
....


*TASK 9:* Edit the main.yml files, index.html.j2, nginx.conf.j2 and remove.yml file accordingly (tree structure supplied below for your reference);

....
